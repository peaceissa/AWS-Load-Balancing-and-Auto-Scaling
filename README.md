## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; We will use this to document everything that we did in this project. some other resources are: [joshseven](https://github.com/joshseven/Cloud-portfolio), 

What to note down:
* Did you work with anyone, note that
* What was the problem you were trying to tackle & how did you go about finding your solution
* any challenges you faced and how did you solve them


### Project Overview
```sh
   Todo and technologies
1. Use AWS s3 (cloud storage service)
2. Upload your files to AWS s3
3. Launch a sample webapp

```

##
```sh
   1. Creating an s3 bucket through the AWS console
```
You need to have a an AWS account, you can get a freetire account which basically means you get a free 1 year to use some AWS resources. In our case, we have that setup and we will be using the s3 service.
* Go to the s3 service
* click on "create bucket" :  a bucket is where we will put our files.
* click on "objects" : obejects are files that can go into the bucket.
##
```sh
   2. Setup Website hosting for S3
```
Webhosting is what allows o a webfile to be served to the internet. AWS offers a free option to host a static website (static is something that doesnt use data from a database).
* Go to your s3 bucket
* Go to the properties tab
* Scroll down to Static Web Hosting and enable this.
##
```sh
   3. Launch your website on s3
```
We have a bucket and its now hosting ready, all we need to do is add our files and we can access the site.
* Go to your s3 bucket and upload "objects". these are your webfiles from your computer
* Go to the s3 bucket properties tab
* Scroll down to Static Web Hosting and you should now see a url.
*click on the url and access your site.
